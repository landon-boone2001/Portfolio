    Writeup:
        I decided to go with making a dungeon crawler game 
        because some of my favorite game genres are roguelike exploration games.
        I am also a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons, and I always draw parallels between
        exploration-focused dungeon crawlers and D&D.

        In the beginning of this project, I felt as if I bit off more than I could chew.
        I wasn't sure exactly how to get started with reading three different .txt files into the program and making sure
        all the stat allocations and event markers ended up where they were supposed to go, much less implementing a combat system.
        But once I got past the initial hurdles, I was able to understand quickly how to proceed through the project. Interestingly enough,
